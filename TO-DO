? select * from pub<Tab>
# completes to
? select * from public.
# in cases of ambiguity, it should show a list of schemas as well as tables.

In turn:
? select * from public.<Tab>
# shows tables in the public schema


Also, I would imagine:

? select * from <Tab>
# shows schemas along with tables that don't require schema qualification.
# [In pgsql, SHOW search_path influences what tables/objects are accessible without explicit qualification.]


Hope that clears it up. :)


I can't recall what mysql's table containment structure is, but PostgreSQL's is:

cluster("physical data directory/instance") -> database -> schema -> table

[Notably, you cannot access a table in a database that you are not
connected to.]
