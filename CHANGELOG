Version 0.1.2 (...)

- Fixed parsing error with the "@" command.
- Dot (".") commands now show up properly in help.
- Added tab completion to various commands. For instance:
  * ".<TAB>" shows the "." commands
  * ".set <TAB>" shows the variables you can set
  * ".set variable <TAB>" shows the legal values for the variable
  * ".connect <TAB>" shows all the database aliases in the config file
  * "select * from <TAB>" shows the tables in the current database.
    (So does "select <TAB>", actually.) This works for all SQL commands.
  * ".history <TAB>" shows the commands in the history.
    ".history s<TAB>" shows the names of all commands in the history
    beginning with "s"
  etc.
