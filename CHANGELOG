- ".show tables" on Oracle will now show non-system tables that belong to
  all users, not just the user who's logged in.

  allowing list of returned tables to be restricted to those matching
  the regular expression.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.6 (04 January, 2009)

  result set output.

  support. Tested against Oracle XE 10.2 for Linux.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.4.1 (4 November, 2008)

- Unknown "." commands are no longer passed through to the database engine
  by default, resulting in better error messages.

Version 0.3.1 (5 August, 2008)

- When loading a file (via ".load" at the prompt or @file on the command line),
  sqlcmd no longer adds the contents to the history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 (22 July, 2008)

- Ctrl-C (SIGINT) at the command prompt now simply returns to the command
  prompt without doing anything, instead of exiting sqlcmd. Thanks to James
  William Pye (x /at/ jwp.name) for the suggestion.
- Added .echo command
- Added ability to specify an on-connect script for each database listed
  in the configuration file. sqlcmd runs the on-connect script,  immediately
  after connecting to the database.

  to work on Windows properly.
- Explicit support for ALTER statement, to permit table completion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  tilde expansion.
- Made more improvements to tab-completion, especially for dot (".") commands.
- Documented how extended (unrecognized) commands are handled.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.2 (17 July, 2008)

- Fixed parsing error with the "@" command.
- Dot (".") commands now show up properly in help.
- Added tab completion to various commands. For instance:
  * ".<TAB>" shows the "." commands
  * ".set <TAB>" shows the variables you can set
  * ".set variable <TAB>" shows the legal values for the variable
  * ".connect <TAB>" shows all the database aliases in the config file
  * "select * from <TAB>" shows the tables in the current database.
    (So does "select <TAB>", actually.) This works for all SQL commands.
  * ".history <TAB>" shows the commands in the history.
    ".history s<TAB>" shows the names of all commands in the history
    beginning with "s"
  etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
