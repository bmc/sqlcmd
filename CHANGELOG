Version 0.3.1 (...)

- Fixed bug with --database option introduced in version 0.3

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.3 (22 July, 2008)

- Ctrl-C (SIGINT) at the command prompt now simply returns to the command
  prompt without doing anything, instead of exiting sqlcmd. Thanks to James
  William Pye (x /at/ jwp.name) for the suggestion.
- Added .echo command
- Added ability to specify an on-connect script for each database listed
  in the configuration file. sqlcmd runs the on-connect script,  immediately
  after connecting to the database.
- Moved WrappingLogFormatter to Grizzled API (grizzled.log module).
- Moved str2bool() function to Grizzled API (grizzled.misc module).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.3 (21 July, 2008)

- Fixed bug that caused sqlcmd to crash when displaying binary data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.2 (18 July, 2008)

- Unicode-related changes to permit sqlcmd to handle databases with
  non-ASCII characters. Thanks to Stephane Matamontero for noting the problem
  and submitting a patch.
- Fixed a problem with history management and multiline commands.
- Documented "sqlcmd.history" module.
- Added --version (-v) command line option.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2.1 (18 July, 2008)

- Now supports the ipython pyreadline module on Windows, allowing sqlcmd
  to work on Windows properly.
- Explicit support for ALTER statement, to permit table completion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.2 (17 July, 2008)

- "@" is no longer an alias for ".load". It's too complicated to support.
- ".load" will now do file-name completion on its argument, including
  tilde expansion.
- Made more improvements to tab-completion, especially for dot (".") commands.
- Documented how extended (unrecognized) commands are handled.
- Fixed log handling.
- Some other internal cleanup.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.2 (17 July, 2008)

- Fixed parsing error with the "@" command.
- Dot (".") commands now show up properly in help.
- Added tab completion to various commands. For instance:
  * ".<TAB>" shows the "." commands
  * ".set <TAB>" shows the variables you can set
  * ".set variable <TAB>" shows the legal values for the variable
  * ".connect <TAB>" shows all the database aliases in the config file
  * "select * from <TAB>" shows the tables in the current database.
    (So does "select <TAB>", actually.) This works for all SQL commands.
  * ".history <TAB>" shows the commands in the history.
    ".history s<TAB>" shows the names of all commands in the history
    beginning with "s"
  etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1.1 (17 July, 2008)

- No longer craps out if $HOME/.sqlcmd/config is missing, but -d (--db)
  is on the command line.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.1 (16 July, 2008)

- First version posted to the web.
